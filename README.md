# UC Berkeley - Introduction to Open Source Software DeCal (Fall 2011) #

## Course Information ##

This course aims to provide a community and a lecture series for students to
learn the skills they will need to contribute to open-source projects, and large
scale software engineering projects in general. If you have ever been interested
in joining an open source project but felt that the barrier to entry was too
high, this DeCal is for you!

There are no papers or exams. We require instead that you attend the class,
contribute to an open source project and present your contributions to the
class. Up to two absences will be permitted for a passing grade.

See the [course
